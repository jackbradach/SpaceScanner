The Space Scanner
-----------------
Q1) Wotzit?

A1) A temperature and humidity sensor toy for small humans.  My small human is in a space phase.
Last birthday they got a space suit with helmet costume ($25 on Amazon!) and a rocket-ship play
tent (Also concerningly inexpensive!).  But, as any parental units doomed to watch space-themed
childrens programming ad nauseam knows, you can't explore space without a "scanner!"

Q2) Requirements?

A2) Must hold the attention of a small child.  Preferably across multiple minutes.

- Brightly colored buttons.  Adults should want to push them.

- Highly visible display, should support animations.

- Must at a minimum beep and boop.

- Do something "real," sensor-wise.

- Fit in one of these project boxes I accidentally ordered way too many of.

- Battery powered, charge via USB.

Q3) What's the BOM looking like?

- I don't know, let's see what my parts box is looking like!

- Elegoo Nano.  ATMega328p, 16mHz, 2k SRAM, 32k flash.  Good 'nuff!

- Sparkfun SparkX Qwiic Alphanumeric Display.  14-segment, single decimal point.
No idea what I got these for but they're pretty!

- 12mm mushroom looking buttons.  Red, yellow, green.  Not the highest quality
but satisfying to push.

- A lazily calculated low-pass filter.

- Adafruit 2.5W Class D amp.  PAM8302A.

- 13mm surface transducer.

- 2200uF big-arse decoupling capacitor;  both the amp and 14-segment can droop the voltage.

Q4) Demo!
